# Visual Studio Code Personal Preference Settings

Just my own `settings.json` preferences for VS Code.


## How can I sync my settings via GitHub Gist?

[Visual Studio Code Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) allows you to sync your settings via GitHub Gist.


## Settings File Locations
Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`
* MacOS Y: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`
* Linux:   `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

The workspace setting file is located under the `.vscode` folder in your project.

If you're not concerned about syncing, you can just copy the files `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` to the corresponding folder on your new machine.


## Extensions File Locations

* Windows: `C:\Users\username\.vscode\extensions`
* Linux:   `~/.vscode/extensions`
